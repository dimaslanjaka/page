For example, a car insurance policy must meet many of the provisions contained in the policy in order to make a claim. In that sense, the personal certificate issued to Mr. Van Huizen should have been used to determine whether Trisura was obliged to defend himself. Because plaintiffs erroneously established defensive obligations based solely on the Framework Directive, the court reconsidered the issue based on its interpretation of the true contractual relationship between the parties. Before Trisura asserted a hedging position in relation to Van Huizen's claims, Van Huizen filed a lawsuit against Trisura and Trisura was obligated to defend and hold harmless Trisura under Van Huizen's insurance policy.
